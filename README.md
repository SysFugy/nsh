# Nyash Shell

Nyash is a minimalist shell written in Ruby. It supports basic command-line functionality, bugged autocompletion, and extensibility through user-defined functions.

### Dependencies

Nyash requires Ruby to run. You can install Ruby via [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SysFugy/nyash.git
   cd nyash
   ```
   
2. **Run the installation script:**

   ```bash
   bash install.sh
   ```

### Configuration

Configuration and functions are defined in the ~/.config/nyash/nyashrc.rb file. You can edit this file to add new functions or configure variables.
